Note:Â Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is ubiquitous in human genes, resulting in mRNA diversity, and has been validated to play a pivotal regulatory role in the onset and progression of a variety of diseases, including viral infections. Here, we analyzed the APA usage across different cell types in frontal cortex cells from non-viral control group and COVID-19 patients, and identified functionally related APA events in COVID-19. 

Requirements
The main requirements are listed below:
Linux
R (4.3.2)

The description of APA source codes
1.APA_Linux
The code is used for getting the matrix with PAS transcripts files as the input for single-cell APA analysis.
2.APA_R
The code is used for calculating proximal rate of each cell.
Braincortex_mt25_dim14r0.1.R
The code is used for data pre-processing, snRNA-seq quality control, cells integration and annotations.
3.F1.R
The code is used for calculating and showing global APA levels in neural cells.
4.F2.R
The code is used for calculating and showing changes in global APA levels in neuronal cells following infection with SARS-COV-2.
5.F4.R
The code is used for showing genes with variational APA levels and differential expression widely affected neural function in a microRNA-dependent fashion.
6.F5.R
The code is used for finding Neurological and psychiatric disease risk genes which are significantly altered in APA following infection.
7.S1.R
The code is used for analyzing cell identity analysis by gene expression.
8.S7.R
The code is used for network to visualize the connection between the CALM1, APP, ACTB, and common neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The description of APA
In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of APA in neural cells from COVID-19 patients at the single-cell level elucidated changes in APA levels in the brains of SARS-COV-2-infected patients and confirmed that these changes impair the function of the nervous system, providing important insights for COVID-19-associated sequelae.
